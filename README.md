Project 3 Local Nomad:

    In a post pandemic era, our group decided that the focus of our application should be local businesses in our communities. 
    As a group of avid travelers we wanted an application where we could plan trips and travel around the USA
    ensuring we could use local businesses and accomendations. As we mapped out what our applcation would 
    look like we decided to break down the data and categories into three main topics 
    entertainment, restaurauts, and lodging. 
    Below is our user stories for how we wanted users to interact with our application:
